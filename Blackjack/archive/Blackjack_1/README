This game is capable of hosting a single player or "hotseat" multiplayer
blackjack game. Currently it has the necessary pieces to play in full but will
need some tweaking to be easier to read while playing. I'll also end up making a handful of additional changes.

Default Values:
	Player Chips - 1000
	Table Minimun - 50
	Table Maximum - 500
	Num of Decks - 4

Simply execute Blackjack.py with Python 3.5.2 and follow the game's prompts.
The default game values can be changed at the top of the BlackJack class.

This version is the first one I consider to be fully functioning. I'm storing this here since it seems like an important enough point to specifially save.
